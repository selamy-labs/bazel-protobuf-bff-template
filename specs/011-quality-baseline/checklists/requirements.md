# Specification Quality Checklist: Quality baseline

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-11-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Two items stay unchecked on purpose: FR-008 names the Go toolchain's statement-only coverage and a condition tool's `select` gap, FR-009 names the first-party Python generators, and FR-011 forbids a mock library. These come from the baseline amendment and the measured state of this tree, and hiding them would make the requirements less testable.
